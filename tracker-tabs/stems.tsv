It features string arrangements, choirs, and his signature soul sampling, frequently branded as "chipmunk soul" for its sped-up and high-pitched nature. Contrary to the popular gangster-persona lyrics at the time, his songs mostly revolved around themes of family, materialism, religion, and racism. The inspiration for finally making his music came when he was in a near-fatal car crash.

	Graduation	(08/30/2005) (Late Registration officially releases) (09/11/2007) (Graduation officially releases)			Graduation is the third studio album from Kanye West. Inspiration came from stadium tours, indie rock, and house music. It was a considerable departure from the sound Kanye had used on his first two studio albums, which featured samples and inspirations from the soul and orchestral music Kanye grew up alongside. This album included a much more electronic sound, featuring layering synthesizers. Lyrically, Kanye analyzes himself and talks about his life after becoming famous and how the media criticize him.

	808s & Heartbreak	(09/11/2007) (Graduation officially releases) (11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases)			Following the death of his mother due to complications after cosmetic surgery, his relationship with fiancé Alexis Phifer finally ending for good, and a struggle to adapt to his celebrity status, Kanye felt emotionally drained and lost. Kanye dealt with his pain by channeling it into a sonically stripped-down album, one dominated by his use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine and Auto-Tune. This album significantly influenced future hip-hop music, having influenced Drake, Future, Travis Scott, and more.

	Good Ass Job (Winter Spring Summer Fall)	(11/24/2008) (808s & Heartbreak officially releases) (05/??/2010) (The project shifts into My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)			As far back as 2003, Kanye had planned a four-album series revolving around going to college, with Good Ass Job concluding the series. The death of his mother derailed this plan, with his fourth album becoming the somber 808s & Heartbreak. People still expected Good Ass Job to release, though, as Kanye's next album as late as early 2010. When the wake of the 2009 VMAs incident happened, it would cause Good Ass Job not to release. The title seems to have changed to MBDTF around May 2010 or atleast not called GAJ anymore. The cover included for this era is the original cover for the single "POWER."

	Hitler (LOVE EVERYONE)	(11/30/2016) (Kanye is released from UCLA Medical Hospital) (05/15/2018) (Kanye restarts the project)			After Kanye was released from UCLA Medical Hospital and diagnosed as bipolar, he bought a ranch in Wyoming where he would produce his next album and multiple albums for his collaborators. The concept of the album came together in 2018. The album's subject matter varied wildly, with some songs being about introspection and change and others discussing his political views. The public name given for this album is LOVE EVERYONE, but it is known that Kanye likely considered the Hitler title longer.

	WAR (Collaboration with James Blake & No I.D.)	(04/??/2022) (The project is conceived) (??/??/2023) (The project is scrapped)			A collaborative project between Ye, James Blake and No I.D. Sessions for the project began around April/May 2022. On his third Drink Champs interview, Ye referred to these sessions as work for "their album". Three songs from the project were played at a party featured on Naomi Campbell's Instagram, with the song "Always" being previewed in full at YZY Season 9 shortly thereafter. The project was presumably scrapped in the wake of Ye's numerous antisemitic comments. However, insiders have stated the project is still being worked on, and was worked on in 2023.

	YEBU (Ye 3)	(10/03/2022) (Ye wears the White Lives Matter shirt) (11/??/2023) (YEBU is shelved in favor of Vultures)			Days before Ye was set to hold YZY Season 9, he suddenly changed plans for the event and wore a "White Lives Matter" shirt. After that, Ye tweeted about going "death con 3" on Jewish people. Following an interview with Alex Jones in which he proclaimed himself a Nazi and claimed he "liked Hitler," many fans and artists gave up supporting Ye and his antics. Following this and an "apology" posted on Instagram, Ye went silent for months and began working on new material in Italy with his frequent collaborators. Reportedly being made at the same time as VULTURES. The cover for this era is from the "Someday We'll All Be Free" single.

A snippet featuring Ty was released on October 2, 2023, leading to the song "BACK TO ME," and confirming a joint album via Instagram. TMZ later reported that Ye was producing both a solo album and a collaborative one with Ty. Then, during the Saudi Arabia recording sessions for Bad Bitch Playbook Vol. 1 in November 2023, the name for the collaborative project between Ty Dolla $ign & Ye would be changed to Vultures, with that coming a sonic change in the project.

On April 2nd. 2025, DJ Akademiks would post a series of Tweets that eventually led to the announcement of a new album titled WW3, separating this project from BULLY.
